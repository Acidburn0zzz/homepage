Dependencies are automatically resolved and installing a library automatically install all needed headers to directly use it. Each edition comes preinstalled with powerful editors like [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) or [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit), while more editors like [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) or [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/) are installed with one command or a few clicks.
