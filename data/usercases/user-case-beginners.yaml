description: Everyone is a beginner in something. So we don't forget people, who don't have much experience with computers and want to learn more or just use it for their work.
features: "Manjaro comes pre-installed with a collection of software that makes all-day tasks possible without even searching for them. If some application is not installed, more software can be easily and secure installed via the integrated package manager: Just search for \"Office\", \"Music\" or \"Internet\", say what should be installed and everything else will be done automatically. All this software is also completely free and will be updated alongside with Manjaro. The Manjaro team and community will ensure that it will stay stable, safe and functions correctly."
